          <h1>Inspiration <br></h1>
        <p> One of my biggest inspirations for going into the topic of social media, and how social media affects mental health, was Men's Mental health month in November. Of course my project is more broad, and focuses on all individuals. I wanted to go the route of picking just men, but wanted to seem inclusive too all. Secondly the layout for the website. Although I'm not sure if this counts as one big scroll page? I decided to steer away from that path, because I wanted my website to be different from others. I then found a bunch of different videos of how others have tried different ways to create web pages. In the end, I went for the slideshow styled website because I thought it was very clean. Although part of me wishes I went for the long page, because then I could have done different animations, etc. I am happy with the way it turned out, although there is minimal animations. For example, I used the underline animations for a links, in which I've used in the past.  </p>
